<p>A time scheduling context, which is used to scheduling either blocking or non-blocking performances within time
constraints. This requires a <em>time pattern</em>, which is constructed via the DSL (see <a href="perform.html">perform</a>).
This at least requires a <a href="../../bvanseg.kotlincommons.timedate.transformer/-bounded-context/index.html">BoundedContext</a> which is a context with an upper and lower time bounds such as
<code>now until 10.minutes from now</code> which is used for knowing what times are being used for execution. This could be
any kind of bounds such as <code>(1.hours from now) until (2.hours from now)</code>, which will wait until the time is within
those two bounds, and use it as a minimal start condition and maximal start condition. The <a href="frequency.html">frequency</a> is used
for constructing how often we are going to perform. This is created <em>after</em> the <code>every</code> operator, and could be
<code>1.minutes.exactly</code> which would mean we are performing every 1 minute exactly. <a href="#">exactly</a> means we are going to
wait until we are on the minute every minute before performing our action. If the time is <code>09:31:13</code> it will calculate
how much time before now and the next minute to execute, such that we perform our action at <code>09:32:00</code> with respect
to millisecond precision.</p>
